## Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

#### 1.4 - 2018-10-15
##### Added
* Support of a pure function as a reducer. Previously, ```WithState``` method supported only the class inherited from ```NetRx.Store.Reducer``` as a reducer. But now there is one more override of this method that supports ```Func<TState, Action, TState>``` as a reducer.

#### 1.3.1 - 2018-10-10
##### Fixed
* Ability to create a string collection as a state field.

#### 1.3.0 - 2018-10-08
##### Added
* Internal wrappers for Reducer, Subscription and Effect. It slightly slows down the store initialization time. But at the same time gives significant improvement in Reducer and Effect invocations and their execution takes much less time.
